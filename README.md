## CoronaVirus

The mission of this website is to assist people in preventing the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

### Scope:

The site is available in Kyrgyz and Russian languages, ensuring accessibility for individuals proficient in these languages. Given the abundance of information in English available online, we have focused on providing resources in Kyrgyz and Russian.

### Rationale:
There is a scarcity of information on the internet in Kyrgyz and Russian languages, with Kyrgyz being particularly underrepresented. Our goal is to translate essential cautions, warnings, tips, and other valuable information, making them available on our website for the benefit of our community. Visitors can stay informed with the latest updates and news related to this disease.
